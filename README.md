😂 LOLgorithm
LOLgorithm is a collection of 5 funny, pointless, and slightly irritating mini web apps built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
They’re made for fun, to annoy friends, and to make you laugh at how unnecessary they are.

🌟 Included Mini-Projects
1. ⚰️ Death Predictor
Enter your birthdate and current mood, and you’ll get:

A completely fake death date

A silly reason for your “death”

The number of days you have left (according to the nonsense prediction)

Example:
Mood: Happy → "You will meet your fate on July 13, 2091… because a raccoon challenged you to a duel."

2. 🙈 Excuse Generator
Type in a problem for a useless chatbot, and instead of solving it, it gives:

A random ridiculous excuse

Possibly something even more irritating than your original problem

Example:
Problem: "I can’t attend the meeting" → "My Wi-Fi only works when my neighbor sings opera."

3. 😂 Mood to Meme
Pick your mood, generate a meme, and…

You’ll get a random meme that may or may not match your mood

Expect some irritating or irrelevant captions

Example:
Mood: Sad → Picture of a cat knocking things over with the caption: “Mood: Destroy.”

4. 💘 Romance Predictor
Give name, short bio, interests, and birthdate of two people (comma-separated).
The “algorithm” works in reverse — the more interests they share, the LESS compatible they are, and vice versa.

Example:
Couple: Alice & Bob (both like coffee) → Low compatibility score.
Couple: Emma & Liam (completely opposite hobbies) → High compatibility score.

5. 🔄 Infinite Loader
A button that… just loads. Forever.

No result. No end. No purpose.

Great for pranks, fake “loading” screens, or pretending you’re doing something important.
